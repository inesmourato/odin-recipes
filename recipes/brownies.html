    <p>Chocolate Brownie</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>For years, I couldn’t seem to find a recipe for brownies that met my standards. 
        Anytime I made homemade brownies, I wanted them to be just like the ones I ate as a kid – super fudgy, moist, and chocolaty, 
        with crispy edges and crackly tops. But the thing is, these brownies didn’t come from a recipe. 
        We always made them from a box. Nowadays, I prefer to bake from scratch, but no brownie 
        recipe I tried could live up to the chocolate brownies of my childhood.</p><p>So this fall, as I flipped through Michelle 
        Lopez’s new book Weeknight Baking, her recipe for Boxed Mix Brownies, 
        From Scratch caught my eye. Would I finally be able to make homemade brownies 
        that would be just as delicious as the ones from a box?</p>

        <li>First, mix together the dry and wet ingredients in two separate bowls.

            and salt in a medium bowl. Then, whisk together the eggs, olive oil, 
            and water in a large one</li>
            <li>combine the wet and dry ingredients. 
                Sprinkle the dry mixture over the wet one, and fold until just combined.
